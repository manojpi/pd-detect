Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and speech. One of the early symptoms can be changes in vocal patterns, such as tremors, hoarseness, or reduced volume. This project allows users to record their voice through a web interface, and the system analyzes specific vocal features using machine learning algorithms to detect potential early signs of Parkinson’s.

Key Objectives:
Accessibility: Provide a web-based tool for early detection of Parkinson’s using voice recordings.
Non-invasive: Utilize voice data to detect potential signs of the disease without requiring physical tests.
Scalability: Designed to be accessible to users from any device with a microphone.
